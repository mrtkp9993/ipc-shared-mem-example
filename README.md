DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION. This example does not contain any synchronization mechanisms. It is only intended to demonstrate the basic concept of IPC using shared memory.

This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of inter-process communication (IPC) between Go and Node.js using shared memory through memory-mapped files.

The example consists of two programs:

* A Go server that writes data to shared memory
* A Node.js client that reads the data from shared memory
